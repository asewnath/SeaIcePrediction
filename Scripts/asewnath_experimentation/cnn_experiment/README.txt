This folder includes scripts for CNN pixelwise or grid cell-wise regression experimentation.
Both Keras and a backend like TensorFlow need to be installed

    -Run the cnn_model.py to train a model and save it to file
    -Use evaluate_cnn.py to test a trained model on hold out data
        -the model72318_pixpos.h5 model is included as an example. This is the
         model that was trained for my poster session
         
    -Sample tensor flow code included but Keras is used for prototyping
