This directory contains the code that I have produced during my Summer 2018 internship.

There are three main experiments in this folder:

    - MLP and Random Forest Experimentation
    - CNN Experimentation
    - CNN-LSTM Experimentation
    
These experiments rely on the function files outside of the directories.
    
Each subdirectory contains a README detailing the purpose of the scripts included. Please
note that this codebase does not represent a final product, but a foundation for future
exploration into these methods.
    
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at akira.sewnath@gmail.com.
