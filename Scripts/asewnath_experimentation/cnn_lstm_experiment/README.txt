This is the CNN-LSTM ensemble experimentation. Keras is essential and needs 
to be downloaded. Keras uses softwares like Tensorflow, Theano, etc
as a backend, so one of these needs to be installed as well. I used TensorFlow
as a backend for this experimentation.

  - To train a model, run the cnn_lstm_models script
  - To evaluate a model, run the evaluate_cnn_lstm script
      - There is a model included to evaluate immediately (cnn_lstm_m5.h5)
